Since January 2023 I have been a PhD student at University College London and the Natural History Museum, funded through a [NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) studentship. Beforehand, I studied geology at the University of Manchester, graduating in 2022.

## Interests

My PhD project focuses on the influence of magmatic water content on metal partitioning at arc volcanoes, and resulting impacts on metal aerosol emissions. I am supervised by [Dr Emma Liu](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/academic/dr-emma-liu) of University College London and [Dr Chiara Petrone](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/chiara%20maria-petrone.html) of the Natural History Museum.

Outside that, my interests include:

* **Education** - I take a keen interest in English education policy.

* **Access to academia** - especially in the earth sciences, which suffers from a large socio-economic gap. My small part to play has been in outreach - chiefly through university events.

* **Science for society** - including the science-policy interface. My research focus has utility in understanding volcanic implications for society and environment.

* **Commodity risk** - awarded £1,000 by BP in 2020 for a policy essay on natural gas use.
