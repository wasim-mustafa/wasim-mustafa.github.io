## Research

I am a PhD student at University College London and the Natural History Museum, funded through a [NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) studentship.

I study how the amount of water in magma affects the way crystals form and how metals are distributed in arc volcanoes. I am supervised by [Dr Emma Nicholson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/academic/dr-emma-nicholson-liu) of University College London and [Dr Chiara Petrone](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/chiara%20maria-petrone.html) of the Natural History Museum.
