Since January 2023 I have been a PhD student at University College London and the Natural History Museum, funded through a [NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) studentship. Beforehand, I studied geology at the University of Manchester, graduating in 2022.

## Interests

My PhD project focuses on the influence of magmatic water content on metal partitioning at arc volcanoes, and resulting impacts on metal aerosol emissions. I am supervised by [Dr Emma Nicholson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/academic/dr-emma-nicholson-liu) of University College London and [Dr Chiara Petrone](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/chiara%20maria-petrone.html) of the Natural History Museum.
