## Search

The `paige-search` layout provides full site search.

Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
outputs:
  home: ["html", "json", "rss"]
```

Example `content/search.md`:

```yaml
---
layout: paige-search
title: Search
---
```

## Customization

If `partials/paige-head-last.html` exists in the site, it is included at the end of the head tag.
If `partials/paige-body-last.html` exists in the site, it is included at the end of the body tag.

Most code is in partial templates that are included by the default layouts.
Elements can easily be added or changed by overriding the corresponding layout or partial template.

For example, the default layouts
`home.html`, `list.html`, `single.html`, `taxonomy.html`, and `term.html`
include the partial template `paige-article.html`,
which includes the partial templates
`paige-title.html`, `paige-description.html`, `paige-metadata.html`, `paige-toc.html`, and `paige-content.html`.
To change the page title for those default layouts, change `paige-title.html`.
To change the page title for `single.html`,
replace the use of `paige-article.html` in `single.html` with the use of
`paige-title.html`, `paige-description.html`, `paige-metadata.html`, `paige-toc.html`, and `paige-content.html`,
then replace that use of `paige-title.html` with your own design.

## Design

The HTML author is the page authors, if any.

The HTML description is the page description, if any.

The HTML keywords is a union of the page keywords, tags, and categories, if any.

The HTML title is the page title, followed by a middle dot, followed by the site title.
If one is missing, the other is used without the middle dot.
For the home page, the title is the page title, if any, or the site title otherwise.

The HTML body can have a header, a body, and a footer.
The header has the menu, if any; the page title, if any; the page description, if any; and the page date, if any.
The body has the page content, if any.
The footer has the copyright notice, if any, and the theme link, if any.

The page title and description can be Markdown. Markup is stripped for HTML and RSS titles.

The page title is displayed in an `h1` tag, so page content headers must start with `h2`.

The page date is the publish date, if any.

Bootstrap 5.2.2 CSS and JavaScript and Bootstrap Icons 1.10.2 are loaded from the Bootstrap CDN for every page unless local Bootstrap assets are used instead.

Map keys, layout file names, partial template file names, CSS names, and JavaScript names beginning with "paige" capitalized in any way are reserved.
